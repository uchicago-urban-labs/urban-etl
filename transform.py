# This file contains both wrappers for petl basic transformation functions as
# well as custom functions built specifically for the Urban Labs.

# To add additional functionality from petl, all that is needed is a quick
# translation of the desired petl function into this wrapper. If functionality
# that is not petl derived is required, it must be added here using the petl
#
